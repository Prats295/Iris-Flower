üå∏ Iris Flower Classification

  A machine learning project to classify iris flower species ‚Äî *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* ‚Äî using various supervised learning models. This notebook covers the full data 
  science pipeline: from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

1) Dataset

 The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) contains 150 records of iris flowers with 4 numerical features:

 * Sepal Length (cm)
 * Sepal Width (cm)
 * Petal Length (cm)
 * Petal Width (cm)
Each record is labeled with the corresponding species.

2) Data Preprocessing

 The preprocessing steps include:
 
 * Loading the dataset using `pandas`
 * Checking for null/missing values (none found)
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)using pair plots and correlation heatmaps
 * Label encoding for target class if required
 * Train-test splitting (typically 80% train, 20% test)
 * Feature scaling where applicable


3) Model Training

 The following models were trained and compared:

 * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
 *  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
 * **Logistic Regression**
 * **Decision Tree**
 * **Random Forest**

Each model was trained on the training data and evaluated using the test data.

4) Evaluation & Results

 Models were evaluated using:

 * **Accuracy score**
 * **Confusion matrix**
 * **Classification report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
 * **Cross-validation** (for model stability)

üìå **Best Performing Model:

> Example: *Random Forest* achieved **97.3% accuracy** (replace with your actual result)

## üîç Interpretation

* Petal length and petal width were most informative for classifying species.
* Setosa was linearly separable, while Versicolor and Virginica showed slight overlap.
* Simple models like KNN and Logistic Regression performed comparably to complex models due to the dataset's simplicity.
